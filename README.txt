A responsive fitness website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The platform simulates a gym’s website and includes five main sections:
Home – Overview of the gym’s services and offerings.
Pricing – Full membership plans, available time slots, and special discounts for certain groups.
Nutrition – Three recommended meals with ingredients, macros, and step-by-step recipes.
Workout – Demonstrations of three exercises with images and detailed instructions.
Questionnaire – Client form collecting personal data, fitness level, activity habits, and goals; submissions can be reviewed.
This project demonstrates front-end skills, including responsive layouts, interactive forms, and dynamic content using JavaScript.
