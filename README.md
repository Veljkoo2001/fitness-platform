💪 Fitness Platform – Web Application

Fitness Platform is a frontend-focused web application designed to provide users with an interactive and informative experience for fitness guidance, workout tracking, and healthy lifestyle tips. The project showcases modern web development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, emphasizing responsive design, interactivity, and user-friendly UI.
The goal of the project is to create a clean, visually appealing, and fully responsive platform where users can access fitness-related content and interact with forms, features, and exercises, demonstrating frontend development proficiency suitable for a portfolio.

🔍 Features

⚙️ How It Works (Program Logic)

1. Static Web Pages
All content is built using HTML, structured semantically for readability and SEO-friendly layout.
2. Styling and Layout (CSS)
CSS is used for colors, typography, spacing, and responsive layouts. Media queries ensure the platform adapts to various screen sizes.
3. Interactive Features (JavaScript)
JavaScript enables client-side interactivity, including form validation, UI animations, toggling content, and dynamic behavior without needing a backend server.
4. Responsive Design Principles
Layouts are optimized to scale and rearrange for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience.
